    "\n",
    "We showcase qubrabench by implementing and benchmarking a hillclimbing algorithm for MAX-k-SAT, described in https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.04975.\n",
    "The paper describes two variants: a normal hillclimber - which uses (quantum) search, and a steep one - which use (quantum) max finding.\n",

    "## Search and Max Functions\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we address the problem at hand, it is important to understand the functionality qubrabench provides.\n",
    "\n",
    "The library includes a set of common functions you would need in various circumstances, for example the search and the max function. These return the result you would expect from other implementations of these functions, and at the same time add in quantum benchmarking functionality. This simultaneously makes it easier to understand the use-cases of the library and makes it relatively easy to adapt existing code to use quantum benchmarking.\n",
    "\n",
    "When we talk about quantum benchmarking here, we mean approximating the amount of calls needed to execute the function with identical parameters on a quantum computer. This library achieves this by counting the calls run on the classical (in this case most likely your) machine and basing performance assumptions on these measurements. All provided functions in qubrabench currently require a stats object, in which these collected statistics and approximations are stored.\n",

This function acts as a predicate to classify the iterable entries. In this case, the first even number is 2, thus we get this as the output of the function call."
